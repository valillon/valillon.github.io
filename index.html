Hi there! In this blog you can read and see some personal artworks and experiments somewhere in between technology and arts.

I'm a computer vision engineer by training, interested on areas like human vision modeling or pattern recognition. In parallel, a dilated education in modern music guided me to grow advanced knowledge on sound designing and audiovisual interactive systems. Basically, I nurture my curiosity by learning new things and experience arts to keep me alive.
