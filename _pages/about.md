I am **Rafael Redondo** and two great passions drive my professional life, technology and arts. I received a strong background on electronics and computer science and I was attracted by areas like human vision modeling, image coding, image fusion or pattern recognition algorithms. In parallel a strong and dilated education in modern music guided me to grow advanced knowledge on realtime audio processing, sound designing and human interfaces.
